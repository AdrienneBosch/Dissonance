## Project Vision

Dissonance bridges the gap between traditional desktop workflows and accessible user experiences. The application listens for clipboard activity, curates captured content, and exposes it through a highly accessible interface. Our goals are to:

- Provide a reliable companion tool for screen reader users.
- Support efficient review of copied content with history and export tools.
- Encourage community contributions that expand assistive capabilities.
